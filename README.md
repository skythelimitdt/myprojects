### UK Food Hygiene Ratings Analysis with MongoDB

**Technologies Used:** MongoDB, Jupyter Lab, Python, PyMongo, pprint

- **Database Setup & Data Import:** Imported food establishment data from a JSON file into MongoDB, set up a database (uk_food), and confirmed data integrity.
- **Data Cleaning & Updates:** Added a new restaurant, updated incorrect data types (e.g., converting rating values and coordinates to numerical format), and removed establishments from Dover as per client request.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Queried and analyzed food hygiene ratings to identify high- and low-rated establishments, focusing on London and new restaurant recommendations.

### Weather Patterns and Vacation Planning by Latitude

**Technology Used:** Jupyter Lab, Python, Matplotlib, Hvplot, Pandas, Numpy, SciPy, Geoapify API

- **Weather Analysis by Latitude:** Used OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for over 500 cities, and created scatter plots to visualize how latitude influences weather variables like temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed.
- **Linear Regression & Insights:** Computed linear regression for each relationship (temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed) based on latitude, splitting the data into Northern and Southern Hemispheres for detailed analysis.
- **Vacation Planning:** Created an interactive map that displays cities with humidity data, narrowed down cities with ideal weather, and used the Geoapify API to find nearby hotels, displaying them on the map with additional details for easy vacation planning.
